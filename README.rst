Statistical analysis of planar point patterns.

This package is part of a `refactoring of PySAL
<https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/PEP-13:-Refactor-PySAL-Using-Submodules>`_.


***************
Introduction
***************

This `PySAL <https://github.com/pysal>`_ package is intended to support the statistical analysis of planar point patterns.

It currently works on cartesian coordinates. Users with data in geographic coordinates need to project their data prior to using this module.

***************
Examples
***************
- `Basic point pattern structure <https://github.com/pysal/pointpats/tree/master/notebooks/pointpattern.ipynb>`_
- `Centrography and visualization <https://github.com/pysal/pointpats/tree/master/notebooks/centrography.ipynb>`_
- `Marks <https://github.com/pysal/pointpats/tree/master/notebooks/marks.ipynb>`_
