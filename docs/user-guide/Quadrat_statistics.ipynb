    "## 1. Quadrat statistics and CSR\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks, we introduced the concept of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR) process which serves as the benchmark process. Utilizing CSR properties, we can discriminate those that are not from a CSR process. Quadrat statistic is one such method. Since a CSR process has two major characteristics:\n",
    "1. Uniform: each location has equal probability of getting a point (where an event happens).\n",
    "2. Independent: location of event points are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine that for any point pattern, if the underlying process is a CSR process, the expected point counts inside any cell of area $|A|$ should be $\\lambda |A|$ ($\\lambda$ is the intensity which is uniform across the study area for a CSR). Thus, if we impose a $m \\times k$ rectangular tessellation over the study area (window), we can easily calculate the expected number of points inside each cell under the null of CSR. By comparing the observed point counts against the expected counts and calculate a $\\chi^2$ test statistic, we can decide whether to reject the null based on the position of the $\\chi^2$ test statistic in the sampling distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2 = \\sum^m_{i=1} \\sum^k_{j=1} \\frac{[x_{i,j}-E(x_{i,j})]^2}{\\lambda |A_{i,j}|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to construct the sampling distribution and acquire a p-value:\n",
    "1. Analytical sampling distribution: a $\\chi^2$ distribution of $m \\times k -1$ degree of freedom. We can refer to the $\\chi^2$ distribution table to acquire the p-value. If it is smaller than $0.05$, we will reject the null at the $95\\%$ confidence level.\n",
    "2. Empirical sampling distribution: a distribution constructed from a large number of $\\chi^2$ test statistics for  simulations under the null of CSR. If the $\\chi^2$ test statistic for the observed point pattern is among the largest $5%$ test statistics, we would say that it is very unlikely that it is the outcome of a CSR process at the $95\\%$ confidence level. Then, the null is rejected. A pseudo p-value can be calculated based on which we can use the same rule as p-value to make the decision:\n",
    "$$p(\\chi^2) = \\frac{1+\\sum^{nsim}_{i=1}\\phi_i}{nsim+1}$$\n",
    "where \n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\phi_i =\n",
    " \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    1       & \\quad \\text{if } \\psi_i^2 \\geq \\chi^2 \\\\\n",
    "    0       & \\quad \\text{otherwise } \\\\\n",
    "  \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$nsim$ is the number of simulations, $\\psi_i^2$ is the $\\chi^2$ test statistic calculated for each simulated point pattern, $\\chi^2$ is the $\\chi^2$ test statistic calculated for the observed point pattern, $\\phi_i$ is an indicator variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to introduce how to use the **quadrat_statistics.py** module to perform quadrat based method using either of the above two approaches to constructing the sampling distribution and acquire a p-value.\n"
