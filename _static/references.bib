@article{VanLieshout1996,
	Abstract = {The strength and range of interpoint interactions in a spatial point process can be quantified by the function J = (1 - G)/(1 - F), where G is the nearest-neighbour distance distribution function and F the empty space function of the process. J(r) is identically equal to 1 for a Poisson process; values of J(r) smaller or larger than 1 indicate clustering or regularity, respectively. We show that, for a large class of point processes, J(r) is constant for distances r greater than the range of spatial interaction. Hence both the range and type of interaction can be inferred from J without parametric model assumptions. It is also possible to evaluate J(r) explicitly for many point process models, so that J is also useful for parameter estimation. Various properties are derived, including the fact that the J function of the superposition of independent point processes is a weighted mean of the J functions of the individual processes. Estimators of J can be constructed from standard estimators of F and G. We compute estimates of J for several standard point pattern datasets and implement a Monte Carlo test for complete spatial randomness.},
