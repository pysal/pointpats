Statistical analysis of planar point patterns.

This package is part of a [refactoring of PySAL](https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/PEP-13:-Refactor-PySAL-Using-Submodules).

Introduction
------------

This [pointpats](https://github.com/pysal/pointpats) package is intended
to support the statistical analysis of planar point patterns.

It currently works on cartesian coordinates. Users with data in
geographic coordinates need to project their data prior to using this
module.

Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is available
[here](https://pointpats.readthedocs.io).
